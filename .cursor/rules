# Cursor AI Rules

## Primary Instructions Source

**All development instructions, patterns, and architectural decisions are maintained in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).**

Please read and follow the comprehensive development guide in `AGENTS.md` which contains:

- Document management principles and contradiction protocols
- Essential commands, paths, and tech stack information
- Architectural patterns and development workflows
- Layer-specific documentation references
- Troubleshooting guidelines

## Cursor-Specific Guidelines

1. **Reference AGENTS.md First**: Always consult AGENTS.md for architectural decisions and development patterns
2. **Layer Documentation**: Use layer-specific README.md files for implementation details
3. **Consistency**: Follow the same meta-principles defined in AGENTS.md
4. **Updates**: When making architectural changes, update AGENTS.md accordingly

## Quick Navigation

- **Main Agent Guide**: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) - Complete development instructions
- **Project Setup**: [README.md](../README.md) - Quick start and overview  
- **Layer Docs**: [layers/*/README.md](../layers/) - Specific implementation details

## Development Workflow

1. Consult AGENTS.md for patterns and architectural guidance
2. Reference layer READMEs for specific component/API usage
3. Follow the contradiction protocol if instructions conflict
4. Use debug tools at `/debug` for development and testing
